# 🖼️ Steganography: Hiding Information in the Image

A Python-based project demonstrating how to **hide and extract secret messages** within images using **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** steganography. Built with OpenCV and NumPy, this project is simple yet powerful for understanding the basics of information hiding in digital media.

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 Hide any text inside an image file (PNG format recommended)
- 🔓 Extract hidden text from the modified image
- 🧠 Uses Least Significant Bit manipulation for encoding/decoding
- 📷 Supports color images (BGR channels)
- 💡 Educational and beginner-friendly

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Google Colab (optional, for execution in-browser)
